# React Pattern

I have played around with React a fair amount now, so time to start over and do some more.  Still using Create React App

## Goals This Time Around

* Use useReducer hook more often than useState
* Build more components, do more testing
* Testing Snapshots, what benefit do they give?
* Mocking data for tests
* Deal with dates consistently

## Things To Do

* Internationalization
* Make directory structure
* Testing (Mocking)
* Add a title to the web app
* Toasts
* Okta
* API Files
* Error Boundary
* User Session
* Check out ReCharts
* Check out Victory Charts by Formidable.

## Later

* Font Awesome
* Lodash
* Storybook
* React Helmet for <head> management
* Change the FAV icon

## Done
* Added Bootstrap using CSS only so far
* Created basic navigation.
* React Router (5.1.1+)
* Built some charts using D3 manually
